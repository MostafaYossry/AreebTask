Hello I'm Mostafa Alsaddek

In this small project I use Eclipse, Java, Cucumber, Junit runner.

I make 2 scenarios
1- Login page
I implement some TCs like login without password, login with wrong Password, login with correct Usernameand Password

2- Purchase Items (Main Task)
	- I Login to home page
	- I filter the products
	- I select some of them 
	- I save the names and prices to use them in assertion later
	- I complete the purchase cycle
	- I logout

You can get the seature file in (src/test/java/featureFiles/SauceDemo.feature)
	
I make a static wait of 3 second in last step of each scenario before closing the window to notice the end of each sceanrio.

I save the locators in excel sheet (src/main/resources/Locators.xlsx)
I make a class to read the locators from the excel (src/main/java/javaFiles/ReadFromExcel.java)

I create a class to Get element by locator after reading the locator from the excel (src/main/java/javaFiles/GetElementByLocator.java)

I create a class that contain all the links I need in this project

I create all needed actions on elements after getting them from GetElementByLocator.java in (src/main/java/javaFiles/JavaFunctions.java)

For Cucumber methedology I create the step definition file (src/main/java/stepDefinitionsFiles/SauceDemoSD.java) that contain the actions for each command in the feature file.

-------------------------------
To run this application you need to import the project to eclipse then Go to Runner file (src/test/java/runnerFiles/Runner.java) then run as "JUnit Test"
-------------------------------
I attach "chromedriver" to this project as I run on chrome
-------------------------------
Note: I use MAC machine and Eclipse IDE for Java Developers Version: 2022-12 (4.26.0)
-------------------------------
Note: I attach a recorded video for run the project after I finish to save my work in case the project doesn't work at your side also, I attched screenshots of the cucumber report.
